# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an intelligent neonatal cry detection and classification system. The system captures real-time audio from newborn babies, analyzes crying patterns using machine learning, classifies the cry type, and provides meaningful alerts to caregivers. The goal is to reduce caregiver response time and improve neonatal care by interpreting the likely cause of crying.

2. WHEN classification is performed, THE Cry_Classifier SHALL output a Confidence_Score for the prediction
3. WHEN the Confidence_Score is below 60 percent, THE Cry_Classifier SHALL classify the cry as normal/unknown
4. WHEN the Confidence_Score is 60 percent or higher, THE Cry_Classifier SHALL classify the cry into the most likely specific category
5. THE Cry_Classifier SHALL complete classification within 1 second of receiving feature vectors

2. WHEN a cry is classified as sleep discomfort, THE Alert_Manager SHALL display the message "Baby may be uncomfortable"
3. WHEN a cry is classified as pain or distress, THE Alert_Manager SHALL display the message "Baby shows signs of pain – immediate attention needed"
4. WHEN a cry is classified as diaper change needed, THE Alert_Manager SHALL display the message "Baby may need a diaper change"
5. WHEN a cry is classified as normal/unknown, THE Alert_Manager SHALL display the message "Baby is crying – reason unclear"
6. WHEN an alert is displayed, THE Alert_Manager SHALL include a visual indicator with color coding: green for normal, yellow for hunger/discomfort/diaper, red for pain
7. WHEN an alert is displayed, THE Alert_Manager SHALL include an icon representing the cry category
8. WHEN an alert is generated, THE Alert_Manager SHALL display it within 2 seconds of cry detection
9. THE Alert_Manager SHALL display the Confidence_Score alongside each alert

### Requirement 6: Caregiver Feedback Collection

**User Story:** As a caregiver, I want to confirm or correct the system's predictions, so that the system learns from my feedback and improves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alert is displayed, THE Feedback_System SHALL provide an interface for the Caregiver to confirm the detected reason
2. WHEN an alert is displayed, THE Feedback_System SHALL provide an interface for the Caregiver to select a different reason if the prediction was incorrect
