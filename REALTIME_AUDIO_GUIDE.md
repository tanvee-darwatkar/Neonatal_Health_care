# Real-Time Audio Cry Detection Guide

This guide explains how to use the browser-based real-time audio capture feature for cry detection.

## 🎤 How It Works

The system now captures audio directly from your browser's microphone and sends it to the backend for analysis in real-time.

### Architecture

```
Browser Microphone → Web Audio API → Record 3s chunks → Send to Backend → Analyze → Update Dashboard
```

1. **Browser captures audio** using Web Audio API
2. **Records 3-second chunks** continuously
3. **Sends audio to backend** via POST /api/analyze_audio
4. **Backend analyzes** the audio and returns cry classification
5. **Dashboard updates** with real-time results

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd Hackthon/Hackthon
python run_simple_server.py
```

The server should show:
```
🏥 Neonatal Cry Detection System
🚀 Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
📊 Dashboard API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/dashboard
💬 Feedback API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/feedback
```

### 2. Open the Frontend

Open `index.html` in your browser:
- Double-click the file, or
- Right-click → Open with → Chrome/Firefox/Edge

### 3. Grant Microphone Permission

When you click "Start Listening", your browser will ask for microphone permission:
- Click **Allow** to grant access
- The system needs microphone access to capture audio

### 4. Start Real-Time Detection

1. Click the **🎤 Start Listening** button
2. The audio visualizer will show your microphone input
3. Every 3 seconds, the system will:
   - Record audio
   - Send it to the backend
   - Analyze for cry patterns
   - Update the dashboard with results

### 5. View Results

The dashboard will update in real-time showing:
- **Cry Type**: Hunger, Pain/Distress, Sleep Discomfort, etc.
- **Confidence**: How confident the system is
- **Intensity**: Cry intensity level (0-100)
- **Status**: Normal, Abnormal, or Distress

## 🎨 Features

### Audio Visualizer
- Real-time waveform display
- Shows microphone input visually
- Helps confirm audio is being captured

### Status Indicators
- **Not listening** (Gray) - System is idle
- **Listening...** (Red, pulsing) - Actively capturing audio
- **Recording audio...** - Currently recording a 3s chunk
- **Analyzing audio...** - Sending to backend for analysis

### Automatic Cycling
- Records 3-second audio chunks continuously
- Analyzes each chunk
- Updates dashboard with latest results
- Runs until you click "Stop Listening"

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Audio Settings

```javascript
Sample Rate: 16kHz (16000 Hz)
Recording Duration: 3 seconds per chunk
Format: WebM audio
Features: Echo cancellation, Noise suppression
```

### API Endpoint

**POST /api/analyze_audio**

Receives audio file and returns cry analysis:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "cryDetection": {
    "status": "abnormal",
    "cryType": "Hunger",
    "confidence": 75,
    "intensity": 65,
    "duration": 2,
    "lastDetected": "Now"
  },
  "timestamp": 1706745600
}
```

### Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
✅ Firefox
✅ Safari (macOS/iOS)
⚠️ Requires HTTPS in production (localhost works with HTTP)

## 📊 Current Implementation

### What's Working Now

✅ **Browser audio capture** - Records from microphone
✅ **Audio visualization** - Real-time waveform display
✅ **Continuous recording** - 3-second chunks
✅ **Backend integration** - Sends audio to server
✅ **Dashboard updates** - Real-time cry detection results
✅ **Simulated analysis** - Works with Python 3.14

### What Needs Python 3.11/3.12

The backend currently uses simulated cry detection because Python 3.14 has numpy compatibility issues.

For **real audio analysis**, you need Python 3.11 or 3.12 to enable:
- Audio file processing (librosa)
- Feature extraction (numpy, scipy)
- ML model inference (TensorFlow)

The audio IS being captured and sent to the backend - it's just analyzed with simulation instead of real ML models.

## 🎯 Testing the System

### Test with Voice

1. Click "Start Listening"
2. Make sounds into your microphone:
   - Talk
   - Hum
   - Play baby cry sounds from YouTube
3. Watch the visualizer respond to your voice
4. See the dashboard update every 3 seconds

### Test with Baby Cry Audio

1. Find baby cry videos on YouTube
2. Play them near your microphone
3. The system will capture and analyze the audio
4. Results will show on the dashboard

### Test Different Cry Types

The system can detect:
- 🍼 **Hunger** - Rhythmic, moderate intensity
- 😴 **Sleep Discomfort** - Variable pitch, low-moderate intensity
- ⚠️ **Pain/Distress** - High pitch, high intensity
- 🧷 **Diaper Change** - Moderate pitch and intensity
- ❓ **Unknown** - Low confidence or unclear pattern

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

**Problem**: "Failed to access microphone"

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
2. Make sure no other app is using the microphone
3. Try a different browser
4. Check Windows microphone privacy settings

### No Audio Visualization

**Problem**: Waveform is flat

**Solutions**:
1. Check microphone is not muted
2. Speak into the microphone to test
3. Check Windows sound settings
4. Try adjusting microphone volume

### Analysis Not Updating

**Problem**: Dashboard shows old data

**Solutions**:
1. Check server is running (http://127.0.0.1:5000)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify "Listening..." status is showing
4. Try stopping and starting again

### CORS Errors

**Problem**: "CORS policy" errors in console

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure server is running
2. Check API_BASE_URL in app.js matches server
3. Server should show CORS headers enabled

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Handling

- ✅ Audio is processed in real-time
- ✅ No audio is permanently stored
- ✅ Only features are extracted (not raw audio)
- ✅ Feedback system stores features only (no audio)

### Microphone Access

- Browser asks for permission before accessing microphone
- You can revoke permission anytime in browser settings
- Audio only captured when "Start Listening" is active
- Stops immediately when you click "Stop Listening"

## 📈 Next Steps

### For Production Use

1. **Install Python 3.11 or 3.12**
   - Enables real audio processing
   - Activates ML models
   - Uses actual feature extraction

2. **Train ML Model**
   - Collect real infant cry data
   - Train classification model
   - Deploy trained model

3. **Deploy to Server**
   - Use HTTPS for security
   - Deploy backend to cloud
   - Add authentication

4. **Mobile App**
   - Create native mobile app
   - Better audio quality
   - Background monitoring

## 🎉 Success!

You now have a working real-time cry detection system that:
- ✅ Captures audio from your microphone
