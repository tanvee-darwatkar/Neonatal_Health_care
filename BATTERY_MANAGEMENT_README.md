# Battery Management Module

## Overview

The Battery Management module provides intelligent power-saving features for the Neonatal Cry Detection System. It monitors battery levels and automatically adjusts system behavior to conserve power when running on battery.

**Requirements**: 9.2, 9.3

## Features

### 1. Battery Level Detection
- Cross-platform battery monitoring using `psutil`
- Detects battery percentage (0-100%)
- Detects whether device is plugged in
- Graceful fallback when battery detection is unavailable (desktop/server mode)

### 2. Power Modes

The system operates in four power modes:

#### NORMAL Mode (Battery ≥ 15%)
- Full functionality
- 100% sampling frequency
- 100% audio duration
- No processing skipped

#### REDUCED_SAMPLING Mode (5% ≤ Battery < 15%)
- Reduced sampling to conserve power
- 50% sampling frequency
- 75% audio duration
- No processing skipped
- Warning notification displayed

#### LOW_POWER Mode (Battery < 5%)
- Minimal power consumption
- 25% sampling frequency
- 50% audio duration
- 75% of processing cycles skipped
- Critical notification displayed

#### UNKNOWN Mode (Battery detection unavailable)
- Treated as NORMAL mode
- Full functionality maintained
- No battery-based adjustments

### 3. Automatic Adjustments

When battery is low, the system automatically:
- **Reduces sampling frequency**: Fewer audio captures per second
- **Shortens audio duration**: Shorter recording segments
- **Skips processing cycles**: In LOW_POWER mode, skips 75% of cycles
- **Displays notifications**: Warns user about low battery

### 4. Power Source Detection

When device is plugged in:
- Always operates in NORMAL mode
- Battery level ignored
- Full functionality maintained

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from battery_manager import BatteryManager

# Initialize with default thresholds
manager = BatteryManager()

# Check current battery level
battery_level = manager.get_battery_level()
print(f"Battery: {battery_level}%")

# Update power mode based on battery
mode = manager.update_power_mode()
print(f"Power mode: {mode.value}")

# Get adjusted sampling frequency
freq = manager.get_sampling_frequency(base_frequency=1.0)
print(f"Sampling frequency: {freq} Hz")

# Get adjusted audio duration
duration = manager.get_audio_duration(base_duration=1.0)
print(f"Audio duration: {duration} seconds")

# Check if processing should be skipped
if manager.should_skip_processing():
    print("Skipping this cycle to save battery")
else:
    # Perform normal processing
    pass

# Get complete status
status = manager.get_status()
print(status)
```

### Custom Thresholds

```python
# Initialize with custom thresholds
manager = BatteryManager(
    reduced_sampling_threshold=20.0,  # Enter reduced mode at 20%
    low_power_threshold=10.0,         # Enter low-power mode at 10%
    check_interval=30.0               # Check battery every 30 seconds
)
```

### Integration with CryDetector

The battery manager is automatically integrated into the CryDetector:

```python
from cry_detection_yamnet import CryDetector

detector = CryDetector()

# Battery status is included in detection results
result = detector.detect()
print(result['batteryStatus'])

# Get battery status directly
status = detector.get_battery_status()
print(f"Power mode: {status['power_mode']}")
print(f"Battery level: {status['battery_level']}%")
```

## API Reference

### BatteryManager Class

#### Constructor

```python
BatteryManager(
    reduced_sampling_threshold: float = 15.0,
    low_power_threshold: float = 5.0,
    check_interval: float = 60.0
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `reduced_sampling_threshold`: Battery % to trigger reduced sampling (default: 15%)
- `low_power_threshold`: Battery % to trigger low-power mode (default: 5%)
- `check_interval`: Seconds between battery checks (default: 60s)

Updates and returns current power mode based on battery level.

##### `get_sampling_frequency(base_frequency: float = 1.0) -> float`
Returns adjusted sampling frequency based on current power mode.

**Adjustments:**
- NORMAL: 100% of base frequency

- LOW_POWER: 25% of base frequency

##### `get_audio_duration(base_duration: float = 1.0) -> float`

## Power Mode Transitions

```
Battery Level    Power Mode           Actions
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
≥ 15%           NORMAL               Full functionality
< 15%           REDUCED_SAMPLING     50% sampling, warning
< 5%            LOW_POWER            25% sampling, skip 75%, critical alert
Plugged In      NORMAL               Full functionality (overrides battery)
Unavailable     UNKNOWN              Treated as NORMAL
```

## Notifications

### Warning (REDUCED_SAMPLING)
```
🔋 WARNING: Battery at 12.0% - Reduced sampling to conserve power.
```

### Critical (LOW_POWER)
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Battery at 3.0% - System in low-power mode. Please charge device.
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run battery manager unit tests:
```bash
python -m pytest test_battery_manager.py -v
```

### Simple Integration Tests
Run simple integration tests:
```bash
python -m pytest test_battery_simple.py -v
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `psutil` library for battery detection

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Full support via `psutil`
- **macOS**: Full support via `psutil`
- **Linux**: Full support via `psutil`
- **Desktop/Server**: Graceful fallback (UNKNOWN mode)

## Performance Impact

Battery management has minimal performance overhead:
- Battery checks: Every 60 seconds (configurable)
- Mode updates: O(1) constant time
- No impact on detection accuracy
- Reduces power consumption by 50-75% in low battery conditions

## Design Decisions

### Why 15% and 5% thresholds?
- **15%**: Standard "low battery" warning threshold on most devices
- **5%**: Critical level where device may shut down soon

### Why skip 75% of cycles in LOW_POWER?
- Balances power savings with continued monitoring
- Ensures system remains responsive to critical cries
- Extends battery life by ~4x in critical situations

### Why check battery every 60 seconds?
- Battery level changes slowly
- Frequent checks waste power
- 60 seconds provides good balance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Adaptive thresholds based on usage patterns
- Machine learning to predict battery drain
- Integration with device power management APIs
- User-configurable power profiles
- Battery usage statistics and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Battery detection not working
**Symptom**: `battery_available` is False

**Solutions**:
1. Install psutil: `pip install psutil`
2. Check if device has a battery (desktop PCs don't)
3. Verify psutil can access battery: `python -c "import psutil; print(psutil.sensors_battery())"`

### System always in UNKNOWN mode
**Cause**: Battery detection unavailable

**Impact**: System operates normally with full functionality

**Action**: No action needed for desktop/server deployments

### Battery warnings not appearing
**Check**:
1. Battery level is actually below threshold
2. Device is not plugged in
3. Battery detection is available
